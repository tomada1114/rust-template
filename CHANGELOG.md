# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The template: a Tauri v2 macOS app with a Rust core, a React UI, CI, and agent tooling.
- Documentation: the README's design rationale, contributing and security policies, a
  code of conduct, architecture, distribution and signing, and getting-started guides, an
  empty architecture-decision index with its template, a roadmap skeleton, issue forms,
  and a pull request template.

### Fixed

- The pre-commit staged guard reads a staged file larger than 1 MiB instead of refusing
  it with `ERR_STAGED_READ_FAILED`, so an icon source, a screenshot, or a large lockfile
  can be committed through the hook.

### Security

- The staged guard catches this template's own signing secrets it used to miss: an
  `APPLE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, or other `*_password` assignment, a
  JSON `"password"` value, a base64 `.p12` such as `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`, a PGP private key
  block, and a Slack webhook URL. An `.npmrc` `_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}` reference is no
  longer refused.
